# Windows Installer
The Windows installer is a self-contained executable that installs the application and all dependencies. The installer is built using the [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) tool.

## Building the installer
Place the compiled binary, icon.ico and a README.md in the same directory as the CtrlPlusRevise.iss file and open the file with Inno Setup. Click the "Compile" button to build the installer.
